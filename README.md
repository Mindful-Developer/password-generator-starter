## Master Python GUI: Build a Password Generator with Custom Tkinter & the MVC Design Pattern!
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a password generator with the Custom Tkinter library and the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern. The MVC design pattern is a widely used architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which displays the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

You'll start by learning the basics of functions and classes in Python, then move on to building the custom interface using Tkinter. You'll learn how to use the MVC design pattern to organize your code, making it easier to read and maintain. By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a fully functioning password generator that you can use to create strong, unique passwords for your accounts.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Python developer, this tutorial will provide you with the tools you need to build your own GUI applications with Custom Tkinter and the MVC design pattern. So join me and master Python GUI programming!
